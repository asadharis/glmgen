glmgen
======

Forked from `glmgen/glmgen`, the repo was modified to include only the R package. This allows us to simplify installation to the following command:

```{r}
 library(devtools)
 install_github("asadharis/glmgen")
```

This was done to allow for easy installation of the `glmgen` as a dependency of our other R package `GSAM`.

 
See the R documentation published at [R docs](http://statsmaths.github.io/glmgen/glmgen-manual.pdf).
